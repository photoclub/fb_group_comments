I put premium into my truck's tank because it keeps my truck's engine performing at its best. I don't put diesel into it because that would wreck it. (Much like your cupcake.) I don't put regular (lower octane) into it because that would also wreck it, albeit far more slowly. (Much like vegetables.)

","You know...
I have no answers for why some people lose fast on keto and not on carnivore.

The only thing I can come up with, is that on carnivore the body gains weight from bone growth, organ growth and muscle growth, so weight loss numbers get lost on the scale.

You're only a month in which means you've only been adapted to this diet for one week or on the verge of becoming adapted. Your journey as a carnivore has only just begun.

Sometimes, people lose weight when veggies are in the diet as much as they are on keto because their veggies are toxic. When we are being poisoned and are sick, we can lose weight.

I'm wondering if this is why some folks lose on keto but after losing the toxic veggies, no longer lose weight on carnivore.

So with gaining weight from a nutritionally dense diet like this one isn't always a bad sign.",Autumn LaRosa,https://m.facebook.com/GarnetDragonflies?fref=nf&refid=18&__tn__=R

","Couple of things to consider.

How long have you been carnivore? During adaptation I had pretty intense heartburn.

How much salt are you consuming? Salt contains sodium chloride. Chloride is needed to make hydrochloric acid. Which is usually what is needed to fix heartburn. Heartburn is usually caused by low stomach acid.

Are you drinking water with your meals? Water dilutes stomach acids. It should be avoided while eating, drank 20 minutes before eating, and 2 hours after eating.",Sam Swinea,https://m.facebook.com/swinea93?fref=nf&refid=18&__tn__=R

","The carnivore supplement option would probably be natural Whey (from kefir). Order some kefir grains, ferment some A2, raw, or goat's milk (avoid regular cow milk for now), and harvest the whey with cheesecloth.

It will take a day or two to reactivate the new grains but after that you'll be able to produce more whey than you can drink.

Back when I ate carbs (and had reflux), ACV would help but stopping carbs fixed all of that for me.

I know reflux is painful but I advise using PPI meds and antacids only as an absolute last resort because they'll only make things worse in the long-run. Try finding the the root cause - it's usually that our stomach acid is being diluted by basic drinks or foods or eating too much in one sitting before you're adapted to be able to do so.

","Hi, yes I have done this and I did lose fat. I am already, or always have had a quite low fat percentage generally. I found that I was increasing my fat when I added extra beef suet (beef fat from around the kidneys). I watched a video from Kelly Hogan about this where her and a friend described altering their fat intake according to desire or by simply trying out different ratios until one can identify one's desire correctly. Anyway I stopped adding fat and just eating a mix of fatty and lean cuts and stop worrying about getting 'enough' fat. I trimmed down in a few days and now I don't add any extra fat though I look for fattier cuts of beef normally. Also if there are only lean cuts available I don't add extra fat to it. I feel much better overall, not only in terms of body composition but just my health in general. I had the incorrect belief it seemed that I needed a certain amount of fat to protein and worked to stick to that but that didn't work for me. I follow my taste and have let go of trying to manipulate my macros - I am training my desire awareness for what I want/need.

I stick to beef, fatty rib eye steaks, lambs liver, bacon, lambs ribs. I have also cut back on eggs. I have now noticed Dairy does me no favours so I have cut that back to butter only.

Oxalate dumping comes in waves and one of the ways is to feel lethargic and that you are crashing. Listen to Sally K Norton all her talks and her entire website.

Also listen to Elliot Overton - great talks. Oxalates have blocked our bodies absorbing minerals vitamins for such a long time, we need to help reteach our bodies HOW to absorb minerals. He talks about upping the intake of Thiamine way higher than the RDA, but also explains over the counter shop bought Thiamine will do nothing, we need a different type to reheat etc.

","You're handling it the way I would. You're being polite, and there's nothing wrong with that. You still need the medical system, bad as it is, and there's no sense in adding fighting and stress to the health problem you already have. They're people who don't know what you do, and you have to be patient (they don't call us patients for no reason) and nice to them.
If you want, you might add something like "" there's quite a bit of research now that shows meat is healthy, though"". Your doc will probably brush that off, but if he doesn't, you can tell him what to look at on the web.
Go ahead and continue to wade though the incompetence of the medical system - you may need it if you break a bone or something. But continue to outmaneuver its bad advice by following the good advice you're learning instead. The healthier you remain, the less often you'll have to go in and listen to them.

I was asked if I wanted to participate in Gene Assessment. I asked what they would recommend if I was found to have this particular gene. Without blinking or baulking the onco told me they would recommend having both breasts removed. I noped right outta there. I would love to take this doctor on, maybe next time. I go every 3 months. I am pleasantly surprised that I am alive. Ovarian Cancer is one of the most lethal. The doctor also asked me how they found the cancer. I told her that I had a mate who died of ovarian cancer, and that when I started feeling full, bloated and tired, I asked my GP for a referral to get my ovaries removed. It was only after surgery to remove inflamed ovaries and tubes that it was confirmed to be Stage 2b OC. The doctor then said "" Oh, YOU discovered it?"" Looking incredulous. Yes, I did.

I think this diet is awesome for being able to experience and learn how we react as there aren‚Äôt too many confusing variables/foods going on in our diets at once.
Once my body found lamb, and organs particularly, I knew what felt right. I was totally in the mood for lamb hearts for months and I still like them the way some people like muscle meat, but lately I‚Äôm more into lamb kidneys. I was feeling so satisfyed by them the other night, I thought this is way better than any dessert!

","This post is just what I needed to read this morning, thank you. I opened this group this morning to write a post about feeling concerned about understanding my hunger signals and over eating. I have concluded from reading here that I probably just need to relax and go with it.

Just day 12 of 30 day Carnivore challenge today.......I made it to day 9 last time I tried and then my keto obession with nuts and dark choc got the better of me. I have had many failed attempts to get going again, so day 12 is awesome for me and I'm generally feeling great.

2 years Keto/LCHF and lots of reading and research meant I really thought I knew my stuff. BUT I was still on a roller coaster of carb cravings that at times ruled my life. I am looking for freedom from that.

I was a master at IF and even some extended fasting so now 'eating when I'm hungry' is new and a little confusing and is taking some adjustment.

I'm trying to fight the feeling of worrying about weight gain (this is the most I have eaten in a long while and I'm definitely not losing weight yet) and worrying about over eating in general.

Trying to trust that my body is refueling, nourishing itself and that if I stick with it, all will become good as my mind and body get the hang of it together.

Currently being in lock down in the UK adds its extra challenges. Constantly preparing food for 3 kids, bordem and few distractions. But I love the idea of coming out the other side of this no longer ruled by food and with some powerful new life choices for myself.

But I also don't want to be fat!!

Trusting in the process....at least for 30 days. ü§û

It‚Äôs definitely an emotional response. It sounds like the sweets were the closest you came to connecting with your daughter. This is one of those times where you have to unwind the action from your diet and lay more attention to the action.
I agree, EFT/tapping, and some counseling or a support group for the loss. And, I would suggest you find a healthy habit that helps you remember the bond with your daughter. If she loved, for example, artwork, or sports, or anything else, perhaps take that up and when you feel the urge to snack on sweets....do some EFT tapping and then pick up the other item to remember the bond.",Jennifer Howard,https://m.facebook.com/jenniferkhoward?fref=nf&refid=18&__tn__=R

Another option is to brush your teeth with super minty toothpaste before you go into the room, bc often that just kills the desire to taste anything. But if you can't get by without snacking, make it some kind of meat you like.

","If you have an infection, you can probably pop 100 mg or so of vitamin C several times per day, but you'll have to watch this, because as a fat-burning carnivore, the ability to ingest vitamin C is sharply reduced, and it's pretty easy, for me, to hit ""bowel tolerance"" with doses FAR lower than I was taking as a sugar burner. Since going zero-carb, I've stopped taking vitamin C on a daily basis, where I was taking 10,000 mg, minimum, per day, in divided doses, prior to ditching the carbs.

I've cleared infections many times within minutes by knocking-back 5 grams of vitamin C, but this hasn't happened to me since I canned the carbs. I imagine that it's still a useful tool, and if and when I catch something, I'll use it.

","I think it's a process, where we go with what we know, and then we learn more, then adapt to our new knowledge.

I was on the Standard American Diet, and ""discovered"" Paleo, adopted it, recovered a LOT of my health. I also dropped from a 205-pound dude rockin' a 46"" medicine ball about the midsection to a 150-pound slim dude, this in only 3 weeks!

So, Paleo must be the proper human diet, right?

Then, I learned about lectins and oxylates, and started wondering about these. Then, I learned that all plants contain antinutrients, and realized that something's still amiss.

Then, I learned about energy metabolism, and how fats burn *much* more cleanly than carbs (glucose), and it still took another couple of years to jump on to keto.

When I went keto, I discovered that I could no longer take the 10,000 to 20,000 mg of vitamin C that I was easily able to do on Paleo.

Vitamin C is an antioxidant. I was able to take it because I needed it. Now, after going keto, I found that I can't really take any at all, because I no longer need it, which pretty strongly suggests that all plants promote oxidative stress, and we cannot possibly get enough antioxidants from plants to undo the damage that they cause, let alone the damage they didn't.

I was quite the Paleo Preacher before I discovered keto, and I have no doubt that people can benefit *enormously* by adopting that approach.

Now that I'm firmly convinced that all plants are more harmful than they are beneficial, I'm weeding them out. When the remaining onions and salsa are used up, I'm zero-carb. I may end up just throwing them out, because I'm not overly enthusiastic about finishing them off.

It's difficult to accept that everything we've been taught about health and nutrition is wrong. So, for me, I just sort-of slid through various nutritional approaches and ended-up here. Before, I thought that some plants were good, while others were bad. Now, I think that they're all bad, and that people who still eat them are malnourished, unhealthy, and loaded with a never-ending stream of systemic oxidative stress, and that it's *because* of plant consumption, more so than any other common toxic exposure.

I wouldn't have been able to accept this 6 years ago when I started my journey, but now I can.

That's progress!

","Good for you! My personal opinion: scales are the most useless piece of crap in everyone's house. They are seldom consistently accurate and folks stress over every single pound. You are not defined by the number on the scale. Your optimal weight is not likely a static number and likely changes based on numerous hormonal and environmental factors., However, folks tend to decide on an arbitrary number they think is their optimal weight (or at least the number they want to see on the scale). This may lead to making inaccurate decisions regarding health and well being. Eat what makes you feel happy and healthy. Base your decision on how you look and feel. Love that person in the mirror. We can all look at people and gauge general health to some degree. Evaluate yourself through your reflection, or through pictures (weekly or monthly).

","Yesterday a friend and I caught up with each other for a talk - which we do every few months. Lots happens in months.

She mentions her gums started bleeding and asks: so how are your gums these days? For a moment, my instant reactions was; gums? huh? And then it hit me. I haven't had gum bleeds for ages, no fancy gum-bleed-prevention strategies, no being careful I don't chew down hard on anything [how can you not chew on meat? It's the ultimate chew-down food!] -

so, be encouraged, folks, good things happen, and then they become such a normalized part of our lives that we forget when it was so bad!

","I don't think you should be surprised, it's a common enough reaction from people who don't know enough. Additionally, plenty of people don't need to be eating the way we do - they process a small amount of plant food extremely efficiently. If she's a good friend, you might want to spend a bit of time and ask her just to listen to how it functions and why so that she'll understand better why you're doing it, and also list the things you've seen improve. She probably needs to hear these things, as well as the message that you have no intention of trying to persuade her or lecture her etc, you'd just like her to understand ""why it's good for me"" - that's the key, make it about you and not some kind of total-ideal type talk, which could come off as threatening. She may also need to hear something along the lines of ""I wouldn't expect you to start cooking anything special for me when we get together, I'll just bring something that's ok for us all - don't want you having to try to figure this when I've already got it down pat."" These are statements that take a lot of anxiety off people who begin to wonder how they'll be expected to cope in order to accommodate you, and whether you'll view them as ""not encompassing and containing"" if they can't quite figure what to make for your special needs. And these kinds of statements - from experience with my own friends and family - make it a whole lot easier to be together without the others feeling judged or that they have to do double backwards somersaults to try and come up with something that works for you.",Seree Cohen Zohar,https://m.facebook.com/seree.cohenzohar?fref=nf&refid=18&__tn__=R

* 1/2-1 teaspoon Himalayan pink salt
* 1/4 teaspoon NoSalt (potassium chloride)
* 1/4-1/2 teaspoon baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)
* 1/2 teaspoon magnesium malate powder (I use this instead of Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate))

I'll increase the amounts if I'm getting cramps. I'll also take an Epsom salt bath since magnesium is absorbed better topically than through our digestive system. I'll also take one or two capsules of Broad Spectrum Magnesium from Pure Vitamin Club before bed if I've had a hard workout or race that day or if I'm trying to play catch up on my electrolyte deficiency.

If I consume a bunch of crap sugar loaded food and/or alcohol, it seems like the magnesium absorbsion goes down and I get more muscle fatigue and cramps.

","Two reasons:

1. Ancient humans were never adapted to kill prey using claws and teeth. Our stomach acid is more in line with carrion feeders, which suggests that our initial forays into eating animals was by eating the remnants of carnivorous animals' kills. Sharp claws and teeth are not needed for this type of feeding.

2. As ancient humans began to use fire for cooking, there would be little evolutionary pressure for their teeth to take on the form of a typical carnivorous animal. On the contrary, cooked meats tend to be easier to chew, compared to raw meat, leading to the type of teeth (and the thinner jaws) seen in modern humans.",Ed Bailey,https://m.facebook.com/ed.bailey.792?fref=nf&refid=18&__tn__=R

We would eat what other animals killed and left or we would chase a prey animal until it died of physical exhaustion. That is why humans are bipedal.

","I am just going to add my 2 cents here...

From my research... It wasn't plants that made us need the molar... Evolved from insect eaters... We had an abundance of amino and fatty acids from insects to survive on but the molars were developed to crush the exoskeleton called ""chitin"". We actually had other systems that have since been evolved out of our bodies, that were necessary for breaking down and digesting the chitin.

Those insect eaters were able to eat fruit when it became abundant in the land but had to choose to follow the climate for fruiting plants or go in search of other food sources when the climates changed.

The iceages made the planets fruit population dwindle and forces the animals down to the ground where they found a much larger source of amino and fatty acids in dead animals. Like dogs we have the stomach pH of scavengers ... Over time the larger amount of fat and protein increased our brain size and body changes to develop more up right movement. And then developed tools to hunt and kill prey and unfortunately hunted many large animals out of existence a lot of this happened before the use of fire for cooking. By then the climate was changing again and we had to learn to cope with less amino and fatty acids and learned to live off plants and grow crops... Our brains shrunk and our height deminished... but we didn't have a need to get rid of those molars... They are proof that we have always found a way to get our basic aminos... üòÅ

Once our ancestors discovered cooking, we could start eating things we weren't evolved to, both plant and animal.

","Think of it this way - animal fights with teeth, claws or runs away. Pick a poisonous mushroom, and it will still poison you even if it is cooked or dried. All plants use chemicals to protect themselves, they don't want to be eaten (except for fruit, that's why they are colourful and full of sugar). Plant toxins are meant for insects, either messes with their hormones or paralyses them, we are a bit bigger, so it takes time but we can develop a gut issue, auto-immune disease, etc, depends on your weak spot, sensitivity and other factors - genetics, pollution. And if you think about fruit and plants. Spinach became popular in 1920s, and now we cannot live without it? Potatoes were introduced to europe less than 500 years ago, tomatoes too. And any plants would have been only available during their season, so for most of human evolution you get 2 weeks of berries, some sour apples and some mushrooms. The rest is meat, all year around.

","I do. I started with my last dog that was declining with age. She was 14 at that time, Shephard mix. Started her on raw animal products and she lived another two years solidly. Literally changed her life for the better. Improved her energy, her spunk, it was so cool. Right to the very end. It was only in the last week of her life that her body said it was time. Up to that point, she was still going in and out of the doggie door and taking short walks on the street even though her appetite at that point had gone down and was sleeping more. No pain. She also never got sick or went to the vet. My current dog I rescued when she was a year and a half. She is 3 years and 3 months now. Started her raw right away. Just for giggles, I bought a can of dog food after she was raw for a good 6 months or so to see if she would eat it. She sniffed it, she tried a taste and then walked away. She eats hamburger, liver, chicken with the bones, beef tallow, eggs, other cuts of meat. She will often not eat every day. Depends on her activity level. She lets me know. If I am feeding the cats in the morning and she could care less about anything going in her bowl then I know she is good. Her schedule seems to be every other day unless we go for long hikes.

","I was suffering from constant cramps in my back, calves, hamstrings, feet & toes. Drinking extra water made it worse, taking salt made it worse. After battling this for many years and trying 7 different bowel cleansers (magnesium) i was ready to give up when a familiar comment in someone else's post resonated to me. They had mentioned Lite Salt, it can be branded Diet Salt, Heart Salt, Nu-Salt, Lo-Salt etc but it is essentially the same thing, it's low salt (about 14%) and high in potassium (about 27%), the rest can be several things so read the pack in case it affects you negatively.

I started taking 1/4tsp 3 x times a day for a couple of weeks and then tapered off over quite few more weeks to taking basically none...after a week or two the cramps stopped and only return when i drink alcohol (yes i know it's not carni...but i like to live life). When it does return i take it for a few days only and i'm good for a few more weeks. I dont see the point in buying a $25-$40 bottle of potassium tablets when a $5 shaker of Heart Salt lasts me a year. I hardly salt my meat now and if i do i generally sprinkle this stuff on because i figure it can only help ;-)

I'm not saying this is your issue but when everyone starts sprouting about magnesium on every post it gets a bit trying and i am only offering my experience for perspective.

","This post is just what I needed to read this morning, thank you. I opened this group this morning to write a post about feeling concerned about understanding my hunger signals and over eating. I have concluded from reading here that I probably just need to relax and go with it.

Just day 12 of 30 day Carnivore challenge today.......I made it to day 9 last time I tried and then my keto obession with nuts and dark choc got the better of me. I have had many failed attempts to get going again, so day 12 is awesome for me and I'm generally feeling great.

2 years Keto/LCHF and lots of reading and research meant I really thought I knew my stuff. BUT I was still on a roller coaster of carb cravings that at times ruled my life. I am looking for freedom from that.

I was a master at IF and even some extended fasting so now 'eating when I'm hungry' is new and a little confusing and is taking some adjustment.

I'm trying to fight the feeling of worrying about weight gain (this is the most I have eaten in a long while and I'm definitely not losing weight yet) and worrying about over eating in general.

Trying to trust that my body is refueling, nourishing itself and that if I stick with it, all will become good as my mind and body get the hang of it together.

Currently being in lock down in the UK adds its extra challenges. Constantly preparing food for 3 kids, bordem and few distractions. But I love the idea of coming out the other side of this no longer ruled by food and with some powerful new life choices for myself.

But I also don't want to be fat!!

Trusting in the process....at least for 30 days. ü§û

","This was a great video as usual!! I so wish I could join the ‚Äòsimple‚Äô ZC life like you and many others and feel great but so far 10 months in my digestion and nutrients absorption is a wreck still. I tried simple when I started ZC in Oct 2019. I came from a high veg diet and was not digesting or absorbing my nutrients properly then and on lots of needed supplements advised by my dr. I weened off all supplements by month 3 and within weeks I suffered with severe bloating, edema, and dry dry skin, and several other issues. Example below of my peeling lips. I dealt with the edema for a couple months before I had to start digging for answers. It was electrolytes. Added electrolytes back edema gone (10 months in and still need electrolytes) The peeling lips found out from nutrients deficiencies mainly in the b‚Äôs (which are high in organ and fatty meats that i eat) but 10 months later still not absorbing my nutrients so back on supplements and now working with Judy Cho (nutrition with Judy) to try to get this all working - I can‚Äôt keep suffering in hopes it will some day all work out. I don‚Äôt comment in this group to much because I feel my body has failed me and this is supposed to be so ‚Äòsimple‚Äô.

","The only way you're gonna get me to successfully swim a 10k now is if I don a buoyancy compensator, arm floaties, maybe one of those awesome rubber-ducky floats (ooh, or those unicorn ones!) and be allowed to lay prone on a buoyant device like a surf or paddle board. A motorized propeller of sorts or a sail and keel may also be required.

I swim like a rock, that is, straight to the bottom. Downside of not carrying any appreciable bodyfat % is that a large portion of your exertion isn't in traveling, but keeping yourself at the surface instead of below it. It's not that ""I can't swim"" as very well can, just in the most un-graceful display of un-coordinated jerks and splashes you can imagine. Imagine that 'guy who tries to dance' but with four left-footed limbs and a neural-disconnect somewhere around the waist. The top half and bottom half are making an attempt, but they are certainly not communicating or with one another, and neither is paying attention to the beat of the music.
-> that's this guy right here <-

Many moons ago at 21y/o, I had successfully swam several 5k-10k's but rest assured it was under silent protest even with BC gear (it was part of my career training at the time). Scary part is the first time I did the event, my bc vest didn't even have a CO2 cylinder installed.

","Same here bud, I think regardless of how you choose to eat ( I am Carnivore) it requires a daily commitment to it and sometimes things can get so overwhelming that it is easy to break off and turn to carbs for solace. But there in lies the problem as food isn‚Äôt intended to be solace, it is intended to be fuel. It sounds cliche but literally take it one meal at a time, my problem is I wanna lose weight by next week that took me a solid 40 yrs of disordered eating to gain. I will tell you this, you are not alone and if my foolish ass can achieve back to back days of eating this way then I know others can. I topped out at 357 at 5 10, i now weigh 244 enroute to 185.

","Good for you! My personal opinion: scales are the most useless piece of crap in everyone's house. They are seldom consistently accurate and folks stress over every single pound. You are not defined by the number on the scale. Your optimal weight is not likely a static number and likely changes based on numerous hormonal and environmental factors., However, folks tend to decide on an arbitrary number they think is their optimal weight (or at least the number they want to see on the scale). This may lead to making inaccurate decisions regarding health and well being. Eat what makes you feel happy and healthy. Base your decision on how you look and feel. Love that person in the mirror. We can all look at people and gauge general health to some degree. Evaluate yourself through your reflection, or through pictures (weekly or monthly). Peoples before and after pics on this page tells you volumes. A measuring tape is also a much better gauge of how you are doing. Anyway, thank you for sharing Amy. You are awesome.

","It is very early and adaptation takes time. Patience is your best friend. At this early stage it is good to eat fatty meat or meat plus eggs and see how you feel. I know that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not enough food if I am cold, can‚Äôt sleep through the night or feel tired. Hunger signals are different and it takes time to figure it out. I don‚Äôt know how you do this, but 100% ZC is much easier then 99%. Initially salt to taste is helpful, later you can decide if you are better with or without it, but salty cured meats make me swollen, bloated and tired. I think 2-3 meals are best when you are starting this WOE. Gaining weight or loosing is a different story. I think eventually most people achieve their best health as long as they stay the way. Depending on your particular hormonal disbalances it may be better to eat more or less fat, but not before you just let yourself eat for at least 6-12 months. 2-3 pounds seems to be an average for the beginners.

","Good grief! I do hope you've read the highly informative materials in our FILES. Inflammation is the outcome of excess sugars [plants], not working out. Bit if you're a fitness coach, just give your classes and don't do any extras until you've become adapted to fat burning. Adaptation tends to take 4-9 weeks, but again, each of us is different when it comes to that. Go easy on your body as far as possible. Give it time to heal and adapt. If there's any way to take a power nap during the day, or even a long full 1 hour nap every other day, that is also extremely helpful bc sleep gives your body quiet time to adjust (try to get a full night's sleep every night). You'll feel when you're adapted - those lethargic symptoms will dissipate. [8+yrs]",Seree Cohen Zohar,https://m.facebook.com/seree.cohenzohar?fref=nf&refid=18&__tn__=R

","I found it really helpful to have grab and go options in the fridge in case of cravings. You want something sweet? Eat a couple slices of bacon. You're bored and want a snack, grab a burger patty and melt on some cheese. Hardboiled eggs are another great option if you like them. Eat as often as you need to at first of carnivore foods and you will gradually get over the compulsive needs and start to learn your hunger signals. Ideally you will get to a place where you eat a solid, satisfying meal and don't think about food again until you're truly hungry.

Breaking it down makes it more palatable, less overwhelming, and less discouraging than thoughts like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never get to eat this or that again.‚Äù I do use chromium to help with carb cravings - not because of a deficiency, purely as a tool. I also brush my teeth and use the strong Listerine after I eat or when I have cravings - this really helps.

Additionally, plenty of people don't need to be eating the way we do - they process a small amount of plant food extremely efficiently. If she's a good friend, you might want to spend a bit of time and ask her just to listen to how it functions and why so that she'll understand better why you're doing it, and also list the things you've seen improve. She probably needs to hear these things, as well as the message that you have no intention of trying to persuade her or lecture her etc, you'd just like her to understand ""why it's good for me"" - that's the key, make it about you and not some kind of total-ideal type talk, which could come off as threatening. She may also need to hear something along the lines of ""I wouldn't expect you to start cooking anything special for me when we get together, I'll just bring something that's ok for us all - don't want you having to try to figure this when I've already got it down pat."" These are statements that take a lot of anxiety off people who begin to wonder how they'll be expected to cope in order to accommodate you, and whether you'll view them as ""not encompassing and containing"" if they can't quite figure what to make for your special needs.

","There's massive income to be made from substitutes and 'going green', not just from direct product development and sales, but from gov't and private sector grants for developments, patents, etc. Additionally, there's huge profits to be made from big pharma. So you will often find that big foodtech interlinks or has subsidiaries / sister companies in big data, big pharma, agritech, recyclable packaging, etc. It will take a long time for the concept of 'meat without plants behaves differently' to seep into professional spheres, and of course that would collapse massive 'health food' 'superfood' 'supplements' and other related industries, including blogs / vlogs / how to recipe and advice literature, and investors don't want that. The ridiculous aspect is that the amount of carb in 'whole', as one example, is way higher than in refined but the danger of refining techniques has been so well sold to a generation of eaters that it's almost written in rock.

Reading above, if you've been dealing with this for 25+ years, be prepared to commit for the long haul of healing knowing that it's worth the investment.

""I tell people to think about how long you've been ill and then it may take anywhere from 1-5 months per year depending on how significant it is, how many genetics variants there are, how significant those are ... so that takes more work.""

","This post is just what I needed to read this morning, thank you. I opened this group this morning to write a post about feeling concerned about understanding my hunger signals and over eating. I have concluded from reading here that I probably just need to relax and go with it.

Just day 12 of 30 day Carnivore challenge today.......I made it to day 9 last time I tried and then my keto obession with nuts and dark choc got the better of me. I have had many failed attempts to get going again, so day 12 is awesome for me and I'm generally feeling great.

2 years Keto/LCHF and lots of reading and research meant I really thought I knew my stuff. BUT I was still on a roller coaster of carb cravings that at times ruled my life. I am looking for freedom from that.

I was a master at IF and even some extended fasting so now 'eating when I'm hungry' is new and a little confusing and is taking some adjustment.

I'm trying to fight the feeling of worrying about weight gain (this is the most I have eaten in a long while and I'm definitely not losing weight yet) and worrying about over eating in general.

Trying to trust that my body is refueling, nourishing itself and that if I stick with it, all will become good as my mind and body get the hang of it together.

Currently being in lock down in the UK adds its extra challenges. Constantly preparing food for 3 kids, bordem and few distractions. But I love the idea of coming out the other side of this no longer ruled by food and with some powerful new life choices for myself.

But I also don't want to be fat!!

Trusting in the process....at least for 30 days. ü§û

","Most quit this WOE is because they don't eat enough meat. In the begining you NEED to eat 2 to 3 lbs of meat a day. Others will quit because of per pressure. Others will quit because a Doc says it's not good for you. My Doc said that to me after labs that came back with all numbers in healthier ranges. IE no longer diabetic, no longer needing BP meds as well as no more thyroid issue's. But they wanted me to keep taking meds. I said no thanks I'm good. I had not taken meds in previous 3 months. This is a group that have not quit, so the info you are looking for is not here. People have all sorts of reasons why they don't want to eat healthy. I started because I wanted to get off meds and lose weight. I lost about 20 pounds the first year(3 or 4 months). Then nothing for the next 18 to 20 months. My body needed the excess to heal it self. So I just kept plugging a long. Now I'm down another 10 lbs. My body knows what it needs. Eat when you are hungry, keep prepared foods on hand to help when you don't have time. I cook 5 to 10 lbs of bacon a week, and about 6to 10 lbs of burger. I still will need to cook more. I like hotdogs so I will eat as many as I need. Sometimes I will eat a whole pack other times just a few. I eat till I'm no longer hungry, but I have been doing this now for 2 yrs. Quit looking for reasons not to do this and just jump in.

","This was a great video as usual!! I so wish I could join the ‚Äòsimple‚Äô ZC life like you and many others and feel great but so far 10 months in my digestion and nutrients absorption is a wreck still. I tried simple when I started ZC in Oct 2019. I came from a high veg diet and was not digesting or absorbing my nutrients properly then and on lots of needed supplements advised by my dr. I weened off all supplements by month 3 and within weeks I suffered with severe bloating, edema, and dry dry skin, and several other issues. Example below of my peeling lips. I dealt with the edema for a couple months before I had to start digging for answers. It was electrolytes. Added electrolytes back edema gone (10 months in and still need electrolytes) The peeling lips found out from nutrients deficiencies mainly in the b‚Äôs (which are high in organ and fatty meats that i eat) but 10 months later still not absorbing my nutrients so back on supplements and now working with Judy Cho (nutrition with Judy) to try to get this all working - I can‚Äôt keep suffering in hopes it will some day all work out. I don‚Äôt comment in this group to much because I feel my body has failed me and this is supposed to be so ‚Äòsimple‚Äô. This was a great video showing that some (like me) unfortunately can‚Äôt make it as ‚Äòsimple‚Äô as this group is. I so wished but as usual my body has different ideas.

","One more thing about what Dr. Berry said, about how our ancestors ate all the organs, brain and drank blood, I don't think it was all that long ago. I remember when I was a kid, my grandparents where farmers. When they slaughtered a pig they caught the blood, mixed it with snow (they slaughtered mostly during winter months) and made blood pudding. The brain was scrambled with eggs from their own hens who were free range and often found on top of the dung hill eating bugs and other insects. Pretty much every part of the pig was eating by all of us.

","The only way you're gonna get me to successfully swim a 10k now is if I don a buoyancy compensator, arm floaties, maybe one of those awesome rubber-ducky floats (ooh, or those unicorn ones!) and be allowed to lay prone on a buoyant device like a surf or paddle board. A motorized propeller of sorts or a sail and keel may also be required.

I swim like a rock, that is, straight to the bottom. Downside of not carrying any appreciable bodyfat % is that a large portion of your exertion isn't in traveling, but keeping yourself at the surface instead of below it. It's not that ""I can't swim"" as very well can, just in the most un-graceful display of un-coordinated jerks and splashes you can imagine. Imagine that 'guy who tries to dance' but with four left-footed limbs and a neural-disconnect somewhere around the waist. The top half and bottom half are making an attempt, but they are certainly not communicating or with one another, and neither is paying attention to the beat of the music.
-> that's this guy right here <-

Many moons ago at 21y/o, I had successfully swam several 5k-10k's but rest assured it was under silent protest even with BC gear (it was part of my career training at the time). Scary part is the first time I did the event, my bc vest didn't even have a CO2 cylinder installed. Lucky for me, it was a reservoir with only a mild current and not open ocean, and I had not yet had the fear of drowning make a personal appearance (keyword: yet).

",I can't relate to your pain but my son's soon to be mother-in-law has been giving herself injections for RA since she was 40. I certainly can't even get her on a low oxalate diet :-( but if it's something you've been dealing with for years and years a few months is not necessarily going to give you instant results so to speak. If it's a lifetime condition it can take many years to see improvement and depending on the severity of the damage might not completely resolve. Don't mean to cast a shadow but this is not medication we're taking it's eating properly to help our body restore itself if it still has the capacity.,Elizabeth Stern,https://m.facebook.com/elizedge?fref=nf&refid=18&__tn__=R

","Here's a quote from Dr. Beth O'Hara (Mast Cell 360) about setting reasonable expectations for healing. She doesn't work in a ZC framework, but I think the idea she's trying to convey is helpful. Reading above, if you've been dealing with this for 25+ years, be prepared to commit for the long haul of healing knowing that it's worth the investment.

""I tell people to think about how long you've been ill and then it may take anywhere from 1-5 months per year depending on how significant it is, how many genetics variants there are, how significant those are ... so that takes more work.""

","As someone with Hashimoto‚Äôs, I don‚Äôt have the type of autoimmune pain that you have, but from working with individuals in all sorts of chronic pain conditions: once you nail the diet, movement is key. Even if it‚Äôs walking around your house.

","I am with you I have many many of this painful autoimmune, muskoskeletal and endocrine disorders they really interfere. Sending heart your way! I definitely don‚Äôt put any expectations on healing just stay grateful for all I do notice. My arthritis pain is definitely less, however things like tears in the spinal cord/degenerative disc, scoliosis, hashimotos, hormones eyesight etc I think these are much more slow to heal if they do I will be grateful. My osteopenia has improved by 14%! I think movement in a stable, balanced way is key. It strengthens the muscles around the bones and introduces proper balance/alignment which helps the body joints/pain tremendously. I also do a lot of stretching including nerve release stretches even when things are acute and I am at home. Hope that helps.

","This way of eating is quite restrictive compared to the standard American diet, or really any other diet for that matter. So, maybe the restriction of it is causing you to think of peanut butter?

","I think you can probably answer this better than we can, Sara, esp since you're zc for a good long while now. Write down the nutrients peanuts contain. Then make a list of the foods you've been eating and their nutrients and see if you can pick up on some kind of pattern. I know you ordered a huge batch of meat, but are you also eating a ton of a certain type of seafood, or did you change the eggs, did you change your toothpaste, are you using a different scented soap, etc.... Just work methodically. This is finicky work but the only way to figure it. FWIW, I occasionally get a 'taste' in my mouth of a certain type of biscuit that I haven't seen or had since I was a little girl - we're talking 50+ years ago!
